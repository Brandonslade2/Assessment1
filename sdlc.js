// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// This is re-organized:

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisofrequirements = "This is the second step, in which developers determine what system requirements are needed for the software. This is to be tailored to the users' capability of meeting requirements. An SRS document is typically created."
const design = "This is the third step, in which the team makes software design decisions regarding the architecture and make of the software solution. Various groups gather together to assist in discussing tools and practices so the requirements may be met"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the programming is implemented. Developers will collaborate with tech leads and project managers to make decisions on how their code should function."
const TestingIntegration = "This is the fifth step, the software is organized into a testing enviornment to assure quality and performance. Much of validating and reporting is used in this stage and is often documented for future reference"
const Maintain = "This is the sixth and final stage of testing, in which after software is deployed. In this stage, it is ensured there are no issues or incidents related to its performance. Changes and customer feedback are commonly received in this stage. Improvements and adjustments are continuously made."
